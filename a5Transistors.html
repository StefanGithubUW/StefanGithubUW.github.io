    <p>Here is a video of my circuit, where the lights scale in brightness based on how close you are to the capacitive sensor</p>


    <h2>Assignment Static Image</h2>

    <p>
      Above is a static image of my circuit. I run two main parts. The first is a circuit used for capacitive sensing. It links a two pins to a 1M Ohm resistor and connects a measuring spoon in through alligator clips. The second section is a LED strip. As we get closer to the capacitive sensor made out of the spoon, the LED's get brighter.</p>

    <h2>Assignment Schematic</h2>

    <p>
      Above is the schematic image of my circuit. The second schematic is based on the class image of how the schematic was pictured, which is why power and ground are not represented in the circuit diagram.</p>
    
    <p>The 1M Ohm resistor is based mostly on what we learned in class, but to my understanding it mostly serves to keep the circuit at a safe level, and to make sure we don't end the circuit with an overcharged capacitor that might pose a risk at a greater scale. </p>    

    <p>I'll breakdown the upper schematic a bit more: The power output is 12V. I use the LED strip with 300 white leds, which are broken down into sets of 3 in series, with each set in parallel. 3.3Voltage Drop * 3 lights results in a voltage of 2.1 through each series of lights, which have a 181 ohm resistor in them netting 2.1/181 = 11.6 miliamps of current. Multiplying this by 100 sets makes it 1.16 total Amps, which is in line given that the max output of our power supply is 2 amps. We can expect to see 12 V across the circuit, with it being pretty close to 12V across the led strip given that there's negligble other resistance in the circuit (the transistor doesn't have too much). Within individual 3 sets, we would see a voltage of 2.1 across the resistor and 3.3 on each LED. The current going in and coming out of the led strips is 1.16 Amps, which is also what we would expect in and out of the transistor when current is moving.</p>
    <p>I am using under 2 amps of current, the transistor can throughflow much more (discussed in q1), and also has a avalanche and continuos drain rating of 29+ Amps (as in all the ratings are higher than 29)</p>

    <h2>Code</h2>
    <p>Citations: I have looked at the Capacitive Sensing code from class. The code I use is my own but I have referenced these resources. Also noting the comment about pinMode initializing, I do not use pinMode in my circuit (It didn't seem to be required), but pin 9 meant to be a gate pin, although we use it pretty much as if it's a output pinMode.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-arduino">
      #include &lt;CapacitiveSensor.h&gt; // Includes Capacitive Sensor Library
  
      CapacitiveSensor capSens = CapacitiveSensor(6,2); // Initiates a Capacitive Sensor Object using pins 6 and 2 (sensor)
      int toWrite; // variable to store brightness to write
      
      void setup() {
      }
      
      void loop() {
        long capSensed = capSens.capacitiveSensor(15); // performs capacitive sensing with 15 samples and stores result in capSensed
      
        constrain(capSensed, 40, 800); // Limits value to be between 40 and 800. This is based on the setting I am in and is not transferrable
        toWrite = map(capSensed, 30, 800, 0, 255); // Maps the value we sensed with capacitive sensing to a analogWrite value
      
        analogWrite(9, toWrite); // writes the value to pin 9 (the transistor gate)
      }        
    </code></pre>
