    <p>Here is a video of my simple circuit. This is composed of two blue led's and a photoresistor. One LED's goal is to light the dark, and it lights up proportionally to the amount of darkness present. The other LED fears the dark, and hides proportionally to how dark it is. There is a short calibration period at the start, where you see me set an example minimum and maximum.</p>


    <h2>Assignment Static Image</h2>

    <img src="A3InputOutputStaticImage.jpg" alt="Static Image of an electronic circuit">
    <p>
      Above is a static image of my circuit. I have a separate section for each light that I run, and another separate section for the photoresistor. Each LED section draws power from a separate port, then also includes a LED and a resistor. The button section uses a 10k resistor instead of a 100 Ohm one, and draws directly from the 5V power port rather than one of the others. It also has a wire that connects it to the input port in order to perform the analogRead operation. Cable management is as follows: Blue Wire = LED power output, Red Wire = Photoresistor Power Output, Black Wire = Photoresistor voltage divider input, White Wire = Ground.</p>

    <h2>Assignment Schematic</h2>

    <img src="UpdatedCircuitA1.png" alt="Circuit Diagram showing three circuits">
    <img src="A2SchematicInput.jpg" alt="Circuit Diagram showing three circuits">
    <p>
      Above is the schematic image of my circuit. I have chosen to depict each LED's schematic, although they are all the same setup. Each pin is supplying 5 volts, and each LED creates a 3.3V voltage drop.  I decided that having them pull from separate ports would be the easiest way for me to allow them to blink individually with my current knowledge, since I could just control which ports were powered. I chose to use 100 ohm resistors since they were the closest to my target resistance (85 ohms). Further, it seems reasonable to adjust towards greater resistance in this situation since picking the closest lower ohm resistor would cause the LED to burn out faster. </p>
    <p>For this project, I have additionally added an image of my input circuit, which draws directly from power and then has a button, a wire to an input pin, and a 10k Ohm resistor into the grounding line.</p>
    
    <p>The calculations I made for the ideal resistance were as follows:</p>

    <p>The rationale behind the 10k Ohm Resistor in the input circuit is primarily based on the advice we were given in class, but I wanted to set the cap on the current in the system for the case when there is no resistance on the potentiometer. In this case, we would have 5V/10,000 = 0.5 miliamps of current- a safe amount. </p>

    <p>I wasn't sure if we needed to explain LED's, but the circuit has not changed since previous projects: I know the port's output is 5V, and that a blue LED has a voltage drop of 3.3V, meaning that the system has 1.7V unresisted with just wires. In order to hit a target current of 0.02A, I can solve the equation 1.7V=0.02A*R for R to get R=1.7/0.02 (or R = 85), where R is my target resistance. However, since I do not have an 85 Ohm resistor, I used a 100 Ohm one, resulting in me solving 1.7V=A*100R, getting A = 1.7/100, or 0.017A as my actual current.</p>

    <h2>Questions</h2>

    <h3>Voltage Divider Resistor</h3>
    <p>
      The resistor needs to be R1 under our current schematic but this does seem like something we could work around. With the way we've set up map, we map with high voltage (low resistance) correlating to writing high voltage. However, we could maintain this by subtracting our read value from the maximum (1023) if r2 was static and r1 was variable
    </p>

    <p>For example, in my current schematic if the static resistor was first and the potentiometer had a resistance of 2.5k ohms, we would have a measured voltage of (2.5kOhms/12.5kOhms)*5V resulting in a Voltage measured of 1 V. In my code this would track as if this was dark, but I could get around it by subtracting it from 5 (or from 1023 as raw analog read input). </p>
    <p>CALCULATIONS GO HERE</p>
    

    <h3>Voltage Chart</h3>
    <img src="A3InputOutputVoltageGraph.PNG" alt="Graph Showing Voltage (Y Axis) over Time (X Axis) for a resistor">
    <p>From left to right, I am displaying the voltage when the resistor is 1: covered, 2: average lighting, 3: maximally lit</p>
    <p>Values were calculated by printing the read input voltage to the monitor, then dividing by 1023 to get their percentage of 5V, then multiplying by 5 to get their voltage. As I didn't gradually lighten or darken in my demo, and I have a reasonably large read time, I have chosen to omit changes between states, but it would effectively curve upwards as the light is uncovered.</p>
    <p>This seems to deviate slightly from what the datasheet implies, but given the potential for variance it seems reasonable.</p>
 
    <h3>Different Bit Values</h3>
    <p>This would allow us to store larger integers and have more specificity in both reads and writes. the 10 bit integer can store numbers from 0 to 1023 (representing 1111111111) and the 16 bit integer can store from 0 to 65535 (1111111111111111). These can be calculated by the formula: Answer = 2^(bit count) - 1</p>
    
    <p>I used calibration for my answer so my map function's next two values (the read ones) after the input to map param  would be formatted the same, but when they were calibrated I would have set the upper bound to 0 and the lower bound to 65535 (representing the same as putting 0, 65535 into the 2nd and 3rd params). The 4th and 5th params (the write ones) would get a min of 0 and a max of 1023, since by adding two bits we basically (not exactly but very close) double the precision available to us twice by about quadrupling our range to map to</p>
